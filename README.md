# Dcrust Societies
📝  I created this website in my first year as I was exploring the wide variety of societies the university has to offer. While the process was quite amusing, it was tremendously tedious as well. Many a time the auditions clash, we miss out on the deadline to fill out some forms or we are unable to meet the expected requirements. And as a newbie, we're pretty confused as to what interests us the most, what we yearn for, and more importantly what field we willingly wish to put our efforts in.

💡  So to put some light on this, I thought a systematic way of dealing with the induction procedure of societies is the best way for students as well as the coordinators of the societies. There will be a listing of societies, the work that they do, their achievements, their goals and vision, and any specific requirements.

⚒️   Currently, the website has been built only using HTML,CSS and JavaScript and the backend is still being processed. I plan on to create it a fully functional website so that juniors can thank me later :)

The website has the following features to offer:

📍  Listing of the societies and the field they are related to (literature, tech, performing arts such as dance, music drama, etc.)

📍  A notification page where announcements for the induction and auditions will be available a day prior to the same.

📍  A login/sign-up page for each student so that when they apply the coordinators have hassle-free information regarding students.

📍  Link to various social handles of university.
